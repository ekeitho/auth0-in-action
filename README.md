# auth0-in-action
build authenticated google actions faster with [auth0](https://auth0.com)



### Why did I build this?

There are a lot of great social integrations to be created on actions on google, 
but working with authentication is a friction point in building out these ideas. 
I want to help developers focus on building their idea and avoid the potential case of someone getting frustrated with the process and give up on their awesome idea.
